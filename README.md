Filter Me!

This is a fun application, that allows you to upload a picture and apply 4 distinct filters. Aside the grayscale, sunshine and palm tree filters, the app allows you to draw on your photo!

Each filter was created by manipulating the pixel and this compromised the run time of each filter. I hope to improve this in the near future.

This application uses; HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


To run the project:
- Clone the application onto your computer and into a dedicated folder.
- Run the index.html to get the application running (this should open in a browser).
